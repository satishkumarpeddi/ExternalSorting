Overview

When the data to be sorted is too large to fit into memory, typical in-memory sorts (like quicksort or mergesort) cannot be applied directly. External sorting is a class of algorithms that handle such situations by breaking data into manageable chunks (runs), sorting them, and then merging the sorted runs via external storage (disk).

This repository implements (in Java):

Balanced merge sort (multi-way merging, balanced fashion)

Polyphase merge sort (optimal merging structure)

Helper utilities / models around run management

The aim is educational and demonstrative ‚Äî showing how these external sorting techniques can be coded and how they behave.

Algorithms Implemented

Here‚Äôs a high-level summary of the techniques in this repo:

Algorithm	Description / Use	Key Features
BalancedMergeSort	A multi-way merge-based external sort where runs are merged in a balanced manner	Ideal when number of runs is managed evenly
PolyphaseMergeSort	A more advanced merging scheme that reduces the number of dummy runs and balances merges across phases	Usually fewer passes, more efficient merging
PolyPhaseMergeSortModel1	Likely a variant / model version of the above, possibly with tweaks or a specific merging schedule	Useful for experimentation and comparisons
How It Works

Here‚Äôs a general flow of external sorting (and how your implementations align):

Run Generation

Read in as much data as memory allows (a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù)

Sort that chunk internally (e.g. with quicksort or mergesort)

Write the sorted chunk out as a temporary run on external storage

Merge Phase

Combine the runs in multiple passes until only one sorted file remains

Use multi-way merging to merge more than two runs at once when possible

In Polyphase merge, manage dummy runs and unequal distribution to minimize the total number of merge passes

The repository‚Äôs Java classes orchestrate these steps, distributing runs, scheduling merges, and handling I/O (or simulation thereof).

How to Run / Usage

Here is a suggested ‚ÄúUsage‚Äù section (fill in real commands / parameters):

Compile

javac *.java


Run

java BalanceMergeSort <input-file> <output-file> <memory-limit> <numWays>


or for polyphase:

java PolyPhaseMergeSort <input-file> <output-file> <memory-limit>


Parameters

input-file: the (large) data file to sort

output-file: the destination sorted file

memory-limit: the maximum amount of data (in number of records or bytes) that can be held in memory

numWays: number of runs merged at once (for balanced merge)

(Adjust naming and parameters to match your code.)

Examples / Test Cases

You should include some sample data and expected output. For example:

input1.txt: random integers

output1.txt: the sorted version

Compare runtime of BalancedMergeSort vs Polyphase version

Edge cases: small file, file size just under memory limit, many runs (e.g. input 1 million numbers with memory limit = 100 k)

Also consider including unit tests / sample drivers.

Performance & Complexity

Generating runs: each record is read once, sorted, and written out ‚Äî cost ~ O(N log M) where M is the run size

Merging runs: multi-way merges in each pass ‚Äî cost ~ O(N log R), where R is number of runs

Overall: roughly O(N log N) I/O dominated cost (since disk I/O is the bottleneck)

Polyphase merges can reduce the number of passes by balancing dummy runs and distribution

You may benchmark memory usage, disk I/O (or simulated I/O), time vs number of runs.

Limitations & Assumptions

This implementation assumes a simplified I/O model (e.g. reading/writing via file APIs or simulation), not highly optimized for real disk-level buffering.

Assumes input records fit reasonably in memory chunks.

Doesn‚Äôt (yet) include error handling for corrupted files, partial writes, or disk failures.

Assumes stable environment; multi-threading or concurrency is not addressed.

You might refine it later to support real large-file streaming, buffered I/O, asynchronous reads/writes, or memory-adaptive merging.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ideas:

Add replacement-selection run generation to produce longer runs

Improve I/O to use buffered reading/writing, asynchronous I/O

Add support for different merge strategies (e.g. Loser tree, tournament tree, min-heap)

Add more robust error handling and logging

Add performance benchmarks and visualizations
